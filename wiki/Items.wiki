Items are found/created how:
Entirely through players. Monsters can take items that are dropped and hoard them.

Items can be created by combining a wooden pole of a certain quality with a sharp metal extension of a certain quality to create a spear of a quality dependent on the items combined quality or so.

Currency is entirely through regular items. Shops therefore, can take any item as currency.
